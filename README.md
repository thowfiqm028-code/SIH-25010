## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an integrated, multi-modal platform delivered primarily through a mobile application and supported by a chatbot interface, designed specifically for low-literacy and vernacular language users.

## Technical Approach
The Smart Crop Advisory System requires a robust and specialized technical approach to meet the unique challenges of small and marginal farmers in India—specifically the constraints of low-literacy, language diversity, and low connectivity.

## Feasibility and Viability
feasibility: The Smart Crop Advisory System is technically and politically feasible. The main challenges lie in ensuring high-quality, real-time data (accuracy, connectivity) and designing for low literacy/network environments (offline capabilities, voice support).
viability: The Smart Crop Advisory System is highly viable from an impact and market perspective, as it directly solves critical problems for a large, growing market with proven economic benefits. The key risk lies in securing a sustainable, long-term funding model that does not impose a high cost on the end-user (the small farmer).

## Impact and Benefits
It looks like you're asking for the general impact and benefits of a concept, technology, or system. Since this is a very broad question, I've used a general search on the impact and benefits of a Smart Crop Advisory System for small farmers in India as an example, as it is a technology with significant and well-documented benefits across various dimensions.

## Research and References
research:The research landscape in Indian agriculture is increasingly dominated by the adoption of Smart Farming techniques, largely powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on their impact on small and marginal farmers who constitute the majority of landholders.
references:Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Journals: The Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences often features articles on cutting-edge experimental agriculture, including smart farming technologies.
